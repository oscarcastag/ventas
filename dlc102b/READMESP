Read these On-line Release Notes
================================

It is important to read these on-line release notes. They are the 
primary release notes. The hard-copy release notes supplement them, 
but do not replace them.

The on-line release notes are on the distribution medium as two
text files:

  *	READMESP
  *	READMESP.txt

The files have identical content.

In addition, the distribution medium includes the following HTML report 
files which list the issues addressed in all Service Packs for this 
release - organized by version, issue number (CR ID), or product component.  

  * PROGRESS_OE_<release#>_VERSION.htm (Lists fixed issues by Version)
  * PROGRESS_OE_<release#>_ISSUE.htm (Lists fixed issues by Issue Number)
  * PROGRESS_OE_<release#>_COMPONENT.htm (Lists fixed issues by Component)

========================================================================

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section contains the following information:
  - Before you install this Service Pack.
  - About the Backup and Selective Install Functionality.
  - Starting the Service Pack Installation.
  - Installing the Service Pack in Silent or Batch Mode.
  - Recovering a Previous Installation.
  - Reporting Problems with the Service Pack Installation.


BEFORE YOU INSTALL THIS SERVICE PACK:
-------------------------------------

1. Make sure you shut down any instances of OpenEdge that you 
   have running before installing this Service Pack.  If you do not, 
   when you run the Service Pack installation, you might receive messages 
   indicating that some files could not be copied on top of other files 
   (because they are locked/in use by another process). Check with your system 
   administrator if you do not know how to shut down OpenEdge.

2. Read through the entire INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS (see next section below)
   before proceeding.

3. If your client and server are installed on the same physical machine
   and have different levels installed, your machine might experience shared
   memory problems.  For more information about this issue, refer to the 
   following Progress Solutions (accessible via the Progress Software Support 
   Web site: http://www.progress.com/openedge/support)
 
   P132 :"What Type of Connection is Possible from Client to Server when the 
          Progress versions differ?"
   P13987: "What causes shared memory version errors 1178 and 1423?"


4. Log in as "Administrator" or as a user with Administrator privileges. If you 
   do not know the Administrator password for your system, check with your 
   system administrator.

5. For UNIX only: Make sure the DLC environment variable is set to the directory
   that contains the OpenEdge installation you want to Service Pack.  
   If the DLC variable has not been set, then enter one of the 
   following commands to set it:

     Shell      Commands (assume "/dlc" is the OpenEdge directory)
     -------    ----------------------------------------------
     sh, ksh    DLC=/dlc ; export DLC
     csh        setenv DLC /dlc



ABOUT THE BACKUP and SELECTIVE INSTALL FUNCTIONALITY
----------------------------------------------------

The Service Pack installation offers you two key functions:

 * The option to create a backup of existing files.
 * The ability to install only those files relevant to your license.

The Service Pack installation will ask if you want to backup existing 
files. If you choose to create a backup, you will have the option of 
changing or accepting the default backup location, and the backup will 
be created for only those files that are about to be updated via the 
Service Pack.  

The Service Pack installation will then determine what OpenEdge 
license(s) have been installed. Based on that information, the install
will unpack from the Service Pack archives, only the files that are 
relevant for the license(s) installed.   

The end of the installation presents the option to review the Service
Pack README file (this file) and the SP(n)-log.txt file which contains
a list of files installed and backed up if a backup was executed. 
The installation saves the readmesp and log files to your Install directory
so you can also view them later.



STARTING THE SERVICE PACK INSTALLATION
--------------------------------------

UNIX:
-----
1. Unpack the downloaded image to its own directory.

2. From a directory other than the Service Pack image directory, issue
the following command:

     <path-to-service-pack-image-directory>/<INSTALL-COMMAND>

Windows:
--------
1. Unpack the downloaded image to its own directory. 

2. Using Windows Explorer, go to the Service Pack directory, and double-click
the 'Setup' icon to begin the installation.




INSTALLING THE SERVICE PACK IN SILENT OR BATCH MODE
---------------------------------------------------

Silent or batch install is available for Service Packs on UNIX and Windows.

UNIX
----
A normal (interactive) installation will prompt you for required 
information with dialog boxes.  

A batch install will not prompt for your input. It will read the required 
information from an installation INI file.  By default, the batch install 
will look for the "install.ini" file in your current directory. 
You must create the INI file before you run a silent install.  
If no INI file is found, the installation will fail.

Here are the contents of a sample INI file:

[Service Pack]
ProgressInstallDir=/usr/OpenEdge/102B/dlc
ReInstall=1
Backup=1
BackupDir=/usr/OpenEdge/102B/SP_Backup
BackupOverwrite=1


To perform a batch install, run the following command (all one line):

<path-to-service-pack>/proinst -b <path-to-file>/install.ini -l  
    <path-to-file>/<logfile.log>

If you do not specify a filename with the -l switch, the install script uses the
install.log filename, by default. If you do not specify a directory for the -l 
switch, the install script uses the first of the following environment variables
found:  TMP, TEMP, TMPDIR.

Windows
-------
A normal (non-silent) installation will prompt you for required information 
with dialog boxes.  

The silent install will not prompt for input.  It will read the required 
information from a response file, typically named response.ini. A response.ini 
file is automatically generated when you run an interactive installation. There
is a file named response.ini that is kept in the <Destination Path>\install
directory.

You must create the response.ini file before you run a silent install.

To have the install program create a response.ini file, run an interactive 
(non-silent) install and specify to record the user inputs with the following 
command: 
     drive:\setup.exe -psc_r -psc_f1=c:\<path-to-file>\response.ini


Alternately, you can manually create a response.ini file.  The following 
sample provides the default responses to an initial Service Pack install:

==========================
BEGIN SAMPLE RESPONSE FILE
==========================
[InstallShield Information]
Version=7.1.100.1242
 
[Application]
Name=OpenEdge
Version=10.2B
Company=Progress Software
File=Response File
 
;
; DESCRIPTION of Welcome Dialog
;
;  Result - is used as the return code for this section. Only a value of 1 is 
;  acceptable.
;
[Welcome Dialog]
Result=1
 
[Service Pack Backup Directory Dialog]
_nSPBackup=0
_sSPBackupDir=C:\Progress\OpenEdge\SPBackup
Result=1
;
; DESCRIPTION of Summary Dialog
;
;  Result - is used as the return code for this section. Only a value of 1 is 
;  acceptable.
;
[Summary Dialog]
Result=1
[SdFinish]
Result=1
bOpt1=0
bOpt2=0

==========================
END SAMPLE RESPONSE FILE
==========================


To perform a silent install, issue the following command:

    drive:\setup.exe -psc_s -psc_f1=c:\<path-to-file>\response.ini 
      [-psc_f2=c:\<path-to-file>\setup.log] 


If you choose to create a log file, the contents of a successful silent install
will be as follows:

[InstallShield Silent]
Version=v7.00
File=Log File
[ResponseResult]
ResultCode=0



RECOVERING A PREVIOUS INSTALLATION
----------------------------------

If you created a backup during the Service Pack installation, you can
restore your installation to its original state if so desired.  Because
the backup saves the files just prior to installing the Service Pack
it is possible only to return to that point.  If multiple Service Packs
have been installed, it is not possible to roll back through each 
Service Pack unless backups have been saved for each installation in
separate directories.  Each backup would have to be restored in the 
reverse order from which they were installed.

To restore your 10.2B installation to its original state prior to
installing the Service Pack, do the following:

UNIX:
    1. cd <path-to-backup-directory>
    2. cp -R * <102B-install-directory>

WINDOWS:
    1. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to the
       <Progress-install-dir>/<SPBackup-dir>.
    2. Choose Edit->Select All, and choose Edit->Copy.
    3. Go to <Progress-install-dir> and choose Edit->Paste.
 
This will recursively copy the files saved in the backup to your
10.2B installation directory, thereby restoring the DLC area to its 
original state prior to installing the Service Pack.  


REPORTING A PROBLEM WITH THE SERVICE PACK INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter problems with the installation of the Service Pack,
or with the OpenEdge product as a result of installing the Service Pack, 
please contact Technical Support at www.progress.com.

PRODUCT NOTES for 10.2B08

a. ADE Tools and Runtime

PSC00247292 : Creating a .zip file on removable media from Visual Translator
causes errors
================================================================================
Creating .zip file on removable media from Visual Translator causes the
following errors:

Error occurred while accessing component property/method: MultiVolumeControl.
Out of present range.

Error code: 0x8002000a Zip adetran/common/_zipmgr.w (5890) Zip: Couldn't open
to write. (15).

Note:  Creating a .zip file on non-removable storage functions properly.


PSC00156958 : Creating a zip file on removable media causes zip errors
================================================================================
Creating a zip file on removable media causes the following errors:
Error occurred while accessing component property/method: MultiVolumeControl.
Out of present range.

Error code: 0x8002000a Zip adetran/common/_zipmgr.w (5890)
Zip: Couldn't open to write. (15).

Note:  Creating a zip file on non-removable storage functions properly.



b. Adapter for SonicESB

PSC00257622 : Client ASK capability for OpenEdge Adapter for Sonic ESB
================================================================================
You must enable ClientASK property both in the Applicaiton Server and the
OpenEdge Adapter for Sonic
ESB adapter. 

For OpenEdge Adapter for Sonic ESB, you must update the OpenEdge Native Service
runtime properties with the values, AllowClientASK and denyServerASK. And, for
Application Server broker, asbroker, you must use the properties,
appServerKeepaliveCapabilities=AllowClientASK and denyServerASK, in the
ubroker. properties file.


NOTE: You must set this property only if your AppServer is operating in
Stateless or State-free
operating mode.



c. DATASERVER

PSC00147674 : DataServer connection degradation in Unified Broker removed
================================================================================
In earlier releases of the DataServer products, some degradation could be
experienced for DataServer connections spawned from the Unified Broker versus
ProBroker.  This was because of some network differences in the TCP protocol
layer.	These have been rectified and DataServer performance using either
brokering tool is now comparable.


PSC00199108 : Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R1 Certified
================================================================================
The DataServer for MS SQL Server has been certified for MSS 2008 Release 1
using the following drivers.

(1) Distributed by Microsoft Corporation
    (a) SQL Server (2000.85.1117.00) - SQLSRV32.DLL  (32-bit)
    (b) SQL Server (2000.86.3959.00) - SQLSRV32.DLL  (64-bit) (10.2A and later)
    (c) SQL Native Client 9 (2005.90.1399.00) - SQLNCLI.DLL (32-bit)
    (d) SQL Native Client 9 (2005.90.1399.00) - SQLNCLI.DLL (64-bit)(10.2A and
later)
    (e) SQL Native Client 10 (2007.100.1600.22) - SQLNCLI10.DLL
(32-bit)(10.2A03 and later)
    (f) SQL Native Client 10 (2007.100.1600.22) - SQLNCLI10.DLL
(64-bit)(10.2A03 and later)


((2) Distributed via OpenEdge 10.2A and OpenEdge 10.1C Service Pack 2
Installation
   (a) Datadirect ODBC Wire Protocol driver for MS SQL Server (5.30.00.54) -
P1MSSS23.DLL (32-bit)
   (b) Datadirect ODBC Wire Protocol driver for MS SQL Server (5.30.00.55) -
P2MSSS23.DLL (64-bit)(10.2A and later)


This certification asserts that for all features tested, OpenEdge clients
exhibit consistent results using the DataServer for MS SQL Server to connect MS
SQL Server 2008 and all earlier supported database versions.



d. DB

PSC00256208 : PROUTIL IDXBUILD has -freeTF parameter for merge buffer memory
management
================================================================================
Adding -freeTF <n> to the PROUTIL IDXBUILD command line specifies whether to
free the merge buffer memory explicitly or 
leave the free to the operating system at the completion of IDXBUILD.

To improve performance, the merge buffers in the -TF pool are pointer swapped
rather than using strcpy(), which results in the list of 
allocated memory chunks being in sort order rather than allocated order. When
the buffers in the -TF pool are freed in an order other 
than they are allocated, there can be severe performance problems on Windows
64-bit. By setting -freeTF 0 on Windows
64-bit, the allocated memory is freed by the operating system when IDXBUILD
completes.

Values for -freeTF <n>:

  0 -- Do not explicitly free merge buffer memory.  The default for Windows
64-bit.
  1 -- Explicitly free merge buffer memory. The default for all Unix platforms
and Windows 32-bit.


PSC00256349 : New DBTOOL option for Schema Fixup
================================================================================
A Schema Fixup option is added to DBTOOL to remove a rare instance of schema
corruption that occurs when physical indexes exist for SQL views.  This
corruption is detected by the Schema validation option, and reported as
follows:

	ERROR: Invalid _object-associate 0 for _StorageObject 2442
	ERROR: _StorageObject 2442 belongs to a SQL View
	Index 2442 is orphaned and should be deleted.

	Total records read: 24

	SQL View Index errors found: 1

	Please run the Schema Fixup option SQL View Index Cleanup.


PSC00232353 : Default value of -napmax is changed to 250
================================================================================
The default value of the broker startup parameter -napmax is changed to 250
from its previous default of 5000.  The value of -napmax is the maximum time
(in milliseconds) to sleep (nap) after the -spin value is exhausted due to
failure to acquire a latch.  Increasing the value of -napmax can decrease CPU
utilization, and can decrease individual user performance while improving
performance of the overall system.  Testing by Progress Software has determined
that 250 milliseconds is a good default.  Changing the value of -napmax away
from the default is not recommended.


PSC00252360 : PROMON Lock table display changes
================================================================================
The PROMON lock table displays are updated as follows:
- A transaction state of "None" is added to indicate that the lock was acquired
outside of a transaction.
- For the "U" upgrade request flag, it is displayed for all upgrades, not just
upgrades waiting on a conflict.


PSC00261450 : VST  _Repl-Agent._ReplAgt-LastTRID is incorrect
================================================================================
The value in the VST _Repl-Agent._ReplAgt-LastTRID may be incorrect.  The
correct value can be obtained from the Replication agent monitor in the 'Last
transaction' field.



e. LANG

PSC00207228 : LONGCHAR codepage ignored during XML parse
================================================================================
If you load an XML document encoded in one codepage into a LONGCHAR set to a
different codepage, the content of the XML document may be corrupted. Attempts
to parse and then save the XML document may then fail.

To work around this, set the encoding in the XML document and the codepage for
the LONGCHAR to match -cpinternal.



f. Management

PSC00206893 : Errors when running data compaction jobs
================================================================================
Invalid records in the fathom.db database may cause errors (13682 or 15747)
when running data compaction jobs.

For example:
Value 108837338071 too large to fit in INTEGER datatype. (13682)

This error can be prevented by deleting records in the cf_sample table that
have an invalid sample_len. These records have a sample_date of 12/31/1969.


PSC00261135 : Error about -keyaliaspasswd when trying to start SSL db from OEM
================================================================================
When you try starting a database from within OpenEdge Management or OpenEdge
Explorer with SSL enabled, and key alias and key alias password provided, the
database may fail to start with an error message indicating that the key alias
password has not been provided.

Workaround: Specify -keyalias and -keyaliaspassword values in the "Other
arguments" field for the database configuration, instead of providing them in
separate fields in the web interface.



g. Open Client

PSC00210558 : OpenClient DLLs available in a strongly named but digitally
unsigned version
================================================================================
OpenEdge now ships a third version of the following OpenClient DLLs for
applications that need strongly named DLLs that are not digitally signed:

Progress.ssl.dll
Progress.o4glrt.dll
Progress.Messages.dll

These DLLS are located in the following directory:

<InstallDir>/dotnet/deploy/strongnamed. 

These new DLL versions are shipped in 10.1C04, 10.2A02, and 10.2B.

To support this choice, the ProxyGen tool was updated and made available in the
10.1C04 and 10.2A02 service packs, as well as version 10.2B.

The new version of ProxyGen replaces the "Use Strong-named Runtime" checkbox in
the .NET tab with a combo box. The combo box provides the following three
choices:

Digitally Signed
Strongnamed Signed
Strongnamed
	 
The new combo box is initially be set to "Digitally Signed", which is the
default behavior.


PSC00202376 : Retrieving a large ProDataSet with Java Open Client is slow
================================================================================
Retrieving data for a ProDataSet with an extremely large record set can be very
slow. This is due to the time it takes to build the parent/child relationships
for the ProDataGraph object in the Java Open Client.

To optimize the performance of loading a ProDataGraph from a ProDataSet on the
AppServer, the new RunTimeProperties.setPostponeRelationInfo() method can be
called before a call to the AppServer to populate a ProDataGraph. If the method
is called with a parameter of TRUE before loading the ProDataGraph from the
Appserver, the Java Open Client does not build the relational lists (accessed
by ProDataObject.getChildRows()). The relational information for each parent
row is built on the fly when ProDataObject.getChildRows() is called.  Note:
ProDataObject.getParentRow() returns null until the parent/child relationship
has been built for that ProDataObject. 

The new RunTimeProperties methods include the following:

  void setPostponeRelationInfo(boolean bpostpone) 
  boolean RunTimeProperties.getPostponeRelationInfo()



h. PDSOE

PSC00209836 : Refresh Cache added to OpenEdge menu
================================================================================
A new menu option OpenEdge>Refresh Cache (Control+R) has been added.  If a
database schema is updated by any tool (DBNavigator or Data Dictionary, for
example), then Refresh Cache should be invoked. This menu option refreshes the
local schema cache maintained by OpenEdge Architect for all the databases in
the workspace.



i. Replication

PSC00248262 : OpenEdge Replication target may need to be rebased upon upgrade
or back out
================================================================================
A change to the format of OpenEdge Replication's recovery control data was
introduced in OpenEdge releases 10.2B07 and 11.2.0.

In certain circumstances, the target database must be recreated by backing up
the source database and restoring a copy of the database to be used as the
target (rebase).

The following releases have the two formats:


- Format A -				     - Format B -
10.2B06 and earlier
						   10.2B07 and forward
11.0.0
11.1.0
						   11.2.0 and forward

The upgrade rules are:
-	upgrading from a Format A release to a Format A release is seamless
-	upgrading from a Format A release to a Format B release is seamless
-	upgrading from a Format B release to a Format B release is seamless
-	upgrading from a Format B release to a Format A release requires a
rebase

Additionally, there is one exception to the upgrade rules.  Upgrading from
pre-10.2B07 to 10.2B07 requires a rebase of the Replication target database. 
Hotfix 10.2B0715 brings 10.2B07 into compliance with the rules and eliminates
the need for the rebase.

Finally, if the database has been upgraded to a different format version (A-> B
or B->A) backing out that upgrade will require a rebase.


PSC00249549 : The maximum value for the -pica parameter is now 1000000
================================================================================
The -pica queue limit has been increased to 1000000.


PSC00246162 : New entries in the Database Service Manager view
================================================================================
The Database Service Manager Status display in Promon has the following new
entries:

*Used HighWater Mark - the maximum number of PICA messages used for this run of
the database
*Area Filled Count - the number of times the PICA queue has been filled for
this run of the database
*Service Latch Holder -  the current holder of the PICA queue; a value of -1
indicates that there is no current holder
*Access Count - the number of times the PICA queue has been accessed for this
run of the database
*Access Collisions - the number of times that there has been collision on
access to the PICA queue during this run of the database (AIW and REPL
attempting simultaneous access)

Access the Database Service Manager Status display by starting promon against
your database and choosing R&D>1>16.



j. SQL

PSC00248536 : DDL to correct CRC errors when using BINARY DUMP/LOAD
================================================================================
In release 11.2, SQL introduces the following special syntax for Database
Administrators who handle problems while migrating database tables from an
older release database to a newer release database. In some cases, there may be
a CRC mismatch error (when dumping and loading data using BINARY DUMP/LOAD).

To correct this error, Database Administrators can run the following DDL
command:

Syntax:
ALTER TABLE table_name SET PRO_FIELD_INFO PRO_SCHEMA_REPAIR

For more information refer to the OpenEdge SQL Statements chapter of the
OpenEdge Data Management: SQL Reference guide.


PSC00181095 : ROWID support
================================================================================
The 10.2B07 service pack for OpenEdge SQL enabled the term ROWID to be
recognized and used as a SQL identifier (such as a column name). This occurs
when ROWID is a delimited identifier (in double quotes) in a SQL statement. 

For example:
	  SELECT custnum, "ROWID" from pub.my_customer where "ROWID" = 10 ;

To enable the feature, it was required to use an OpenEdge startup parameter,
-SQLQuotedRowid, and specify it with the value "std". 

For example:
	    mprosrv -S	1234 -H myhost -SQLQuotedRowid std 


If the new startup parameter was not used or was used and its value was not
"std", then a quoted "ROWID" was interpreted as a reference to the ROWID
function

From release 11.2 onwards, this startup parameter is no longer required and the
feature is enabled by default.

Any unquoted use of ROWID, as earlier, continues to be interpreted as a
reference to the ROWID function.

To use this feature as in the previous versions, you can use the startup
parameter, -SQLQuotedRowid, with a value other than "std". If the new startup
parameter is used and its value is not "std", then a quoted "ROWID" is
interpreted as a reference to the ROWID function.


PSC00161214 : Using aliases in an ORDER BY clause containing set operators
================================================================================
Prior to 11.2, SQL displayed a syntax error when a query containing a set
operator (such as, UNION) included a column alias in the ORDER BY clause.  

From release 11.2 onwards, a query containing set operators (UNION, INTERSECT,
or MINUS) can include column names and aliases in the ORDER BY clause. The
column name or alias indicates ordering based on the corresponding column from
all the query expressions (SELECT statements) in the set operator.



LIST OF ISSUES ADDRESSED IN 10.2B SERVICE PACKS:

PSC00279622
=============================
There is a small window where using one of the commands below simultaneously
with a user in the process of logging out of the database can result in a
database crash due to a timing issue between the two operations.  

    proshut <db> -C list
    proshut <db> -list
    promon options 8. db shutdown

The trace contains the routine nsawho().


PSC00278145
=============================
An extra combo-box VALUE-CHANGED event is generated
****************************************
A combo-box's VALUE-CHANGED trigger may fire an extra time when leaving a
combo-box using the Tab key after changing the selection using the keyboard.


PSC00270050
=============================
The SQL engine crashes when using the set operators INTERSECT and MINUS with
SELECT statements that contain more than 15 columns in the column list.
If the number of columns is between 16 and 24, the query may not crash, but
rather give incorrect results and/or internal errors.


PSC00267916
=============================
DBRPR fails to parse the whole index block when it contains index keys with
recids larger than 2 billion (as well as with recids less than 2 billions):
Invalid information field size (65) in index entry;remainder of block skipped


PSC00267827
=============================
The "_TableStat-Read" field value is incorrect for SQL client queries for Type
II Area tables.


PSC00262763
=============================
A client transaction "hangs" in an infinite loop reading the same index blocks,
when ALL of the following conditions are present:
   - The index has to be unique. 
   - The entry to be inserted is a 64 bit entry. 
   - The place holder with the same real key value is a 32 entry. 
   - This place holder has to be deleted by the same transaction. 
   - The block does not have enough space and is about to split. 
   - There is at least one place holder in the block that belongs to a
committed or dead transaction.


PSC00262218
=============================
AUDITLOAD throws index errors
****************************************
Audit Data Load reporting index corruption when audit dump files contain
duplicate audit records for example by running auditdump with overlapping
date-time ranges.  There is no index corruption as a result.
Error creating key for index 1085 of table -200


PSC00262036
=============================

More than 13 "IN" in WHERE statement causes huge performance dro
****************************************
When using WHERE IN statements in a complex SQL query for very large tables
(millions of rows) , if 13 or more IN values are present the performance of the
query execution drops. The time of execution goes from a couple of seconds
(with less than 13 IN) to 10+ minutes (when adding 13 or more IN). 

If the same query is modified and the WHERE IN statement is replaced by WHERE
OR then you can add more than 13 values and the query executes in a few
seconds.

This problem can occur when one (or more) of the tables has associated indexes
which contain some index key values with  many, many duplicate values and other
index key values with many fewer key values. In other words, this problem is
related to skewed key value distribution.

recognizes that a temp-table in the base class is not the same as the one
stored in the r-code of the inheritor and this causes the following errors to
occur:

TEMP-TABLE '<temp-table>' of class '<inheritorclass>' no longer matches the
definition in base class '<baseclass>'. (13203)

has the BGCOLOR set before moving columns. Field A and Field B have their
columns switched. Now Field B gets focus - it's rendered with the colors Field
A is supposed to have.

PSC00228902
=============================
Ambiguous OO method call in chain fails
****************************************
The AVM might not run the correct overloading of a method if the method is
called as part of a chain of references with 3 or more elements and the
overloading resolution was deferred by the compiler until run time.  In this
case, the AVM currently chooses the first overloading in the source file. So,
if the first overloading happens to be the one that is intended, the call will
work. The method call can be ambiguous at compile time for any of the reasons
that make method calls ambiguous: one or more arguments provided by
DYNAMIC-FUNCTION/DYNAMIC-INVOKE, temp-table/ProDataSet parameters, array
parameters, etc.

This incorrect run-time resolution leads to one of the following outcomes:

    o  The error, "Mismatched number of parameters passed to routine <name>.
(3234)," might be raised (this seems to be most common).
    o  The session might crash without further error.
    o  An error might be raised that parameters cannot be pushed onto the
stack.
    o  The correct method might execute because, by coincidence, the AVM chose
the intended overloading.
    o  The wrong method might execute, but not raise an error because it does
not use the arguments it receives in a way that would cause an error. So, the
outcome of the call might not be what the developer intended.


PSC00228853
=============================
Combo format truncates UTF-8 data
****************************************
If a FORMAT phrase is specified for a combo box, then that format specifies

.NET Application fails when run from a netsetup installation
****************************************
A .NET based application running from a netsetup installation of an OpenEdge
service pack may fail to run and display errors indicating some type of
permission or security problem. This is due to a problem where the netsetup
installtion of a service pack does not install the 3.0 .NET framework, nor does
it prompt to accept/reject adding the OpenEdge directory to the local intranet
FullTrust zone.
A workaround for this problem is:
1) run regedit to modify the registry
2) rename the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/.NETFramework/v3.0 key to
some other name
3) uninstall the netsetup installation
4) reinstall the netsetup installation, this time answering yes to installing
the 3.0 .NET framework, and yes to adding OpenEdge to the local intranet
FullTrust zone.
5) Rename the changed v3.0 key back to the original name.

with an ABL destructor is garbage collected. The message displayed during the
crash is:
  SYSTEM ERROR when invoking ABL method <method-name> from .NET 
     Exception code: C0000005 ACCESS_VIOLATION 

The prevalent manifestation of this crash is when an ABL Form overrides
WndProc, and has a hybrid control on it which has a destructor. If the form is
explicitly destroyed from the ABL during the formClosed event, and the hybrid
control is not explicitly destroyed during the form's destructor, the AVM will
crash on returning from WndProc.

SQL92 CREATE trigger not allowing to open cursors - grant needed
****************************************
If the required permission to use a sequence is not granted to a user, then
that user can get an access denied error when a sQL92 CREATE trigger is trying
to open a cursor and the sql statement uses a sequence.
This is not a bug. Error "permission denied" is returned when a sequence is
accessed from the trigger and trigger owner does not have permissions to
update/access the sequence.
In this case owner of the trigger "PUB" should be given update permissions on
the sequence, then trigger should work:
	   grant update on sequence pub.nextcustnum to pub;

If the Create trigger is created under any user but PUB, and if this user has
privilleges to update the sequence, then trigger will run fine.

No INPUT error when using UTF-8 and -ucc parameter on TTY Client
****************************************
Using -cpinternal utf-8 -cpstream utf-8 -ucc on the character client executable
results in error 557 not being generated when inputting data using INPUT FROM.
Error 557 should occur when the data being input is longer the FORMAT of the
variable it is being input into.


PSC00221570
=============================
Overridden property does not get called from abstract class
****************************************
The GET accessor of an overridden property in child class does not get called
from within an abstract parent class.
The GET accessor is never invoked when it is being referred to from within the
parent class. With a method instead of a property this scenario does work. Also
when the overridden property is accessed from outside the class it does work.
The SET accessor also works correctly, regardless of where it is accessed. 


PSC00221536
=============================
Architect Debugger crashes when buffer exists in Expressions
****************************************
When a buffer is added to the Expressions list in the Debugger, error 51 occurs

PSC00221495
=============================
PBS with recursive rels displays flat when data-source detached
****************************************
When displaying data from a dataset that has recursive relations in an
UltraGrid or UltraWinTree, as long as the buffer in the dataset has a
data-source attached, the data display as expected, i.e. nested, however when
the data-source is detached, or no data-source is used, the display is flat
(i.e. none of the rows have child relations).


PSC00221438
=============================
_probrkr leaks handles causing machine to exhause resource

_probrkr does not release handles after _orasrv is dismissed, therefore it
causes the system to freeze after many connects and disconnects


PSC00221429
=============================
Invalid otmTypeEntry causes crash
****************************************
The compiler may flush part of an OOABL class hierarchy from memory when this
should not happen. This will cause references to static class members to fail
and cause a crash.

This is seen when a member is referenced using the static type name syntax, the
class is recompiled and  NEW'ed, and a second attempt is made to reference the
member again using the static type name syntax


PSC00221276
=============================
Decimal conversion fails when user enters 0 in UltranumericEdito
****************************************
When the user enters 0 into an Infragistics UltraNumericEditor, decimal

=============================
Dialog loses focus, may hang when editor called from .NET form
****************************************
If _edit.p is called through a chain that includes a .NET form, code syntax is
checked with F2 or Shift-F2, and errors are found, the error dialog is hidden
behind the procedure editor. If the user then presses F2 or Shift-F2 again, the
dialog will come to the front, but neither keyboard or mouse input will make
the buttons work, even though the dotted lines appear to show that they are
selected.


PSC00220899

When executing a 'MESSAGE ... VIEW-AS ALERT-BOX' in a LEAVE trigger for an
ultraTextEditor which was the result of pressing the TAB key, focus stays in
the ultraTextEditor.


PSC00220649
=============================
Add Procedure dialog missing the option to set PRIVATE option
****************************************
The "Add Procedure" dialog is missing a toggle to specify an internal procedure
as private. As the ABL does support defining internal procedures as PRIVATE,
this dialog should have a matching toggle as well.
This is inconsistent with similar behavior in Add function Dialog, where we can
mark a function as Private. 


PSC00220641
=============================
Dynamic Browse generates protrace and core file on TTY client
****************************************
ABL code that creates a dynamic browse in an OpenEdge character client may
crash. The problem occurs when the frame which contains the browse is not large
enough. The same code can be executed in the OpenEdge Windows GUI client
without problems.


PSC00220603
=============================
Launch Configuration logging level is set 1 level higher in AVM
****************************************
Setting a global logging level in a Run Configuration (at the top of the
logging tab where log file etc. are specified) will result in the AVM using a
logging level that is 1 higher than the one specified.
For example, setting a logging level "Basic" results in the AVM setting the
logging level to 3 where it should be 2.

Setting the logging level per entry type does use the correct logging levels.


PSC00220593
=============================
dbtool processes CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT incorrectly when win closed

****************************************
When inserting code into editor via Source -> Add
Procedure/Function/Method/Property, etc. or auto-generation of code in cases of
interface implementations, etc. excessive numbers of blank lines are inserted
in the editor code block. These appear below (and sometimes above) the group of
equal blocks, for example after all internal procedures when procedures are
added. Similarly, within a class file (.cls) spaces are inserted before the END
CLASS statement.

LEAVE doesn't fire in ABL window when focus given to .NET form
****************************************
When both .NET forms and ABL windows are part of the same application, the
LEAVE event does not fire in an ABL window when focus is given to a.NET form.
This is not consistent with what the user experiences when focus is shifted
from one ABL window to another.

=============================
ESQL/C: SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL fails w Static Statement
****************************************
ESQL/C: Once the TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL has been set in an ESQL/C program,
it can not be changed for subsequent Static SQL statements executed on the same
Connection object.
As of OE sql 10.2B01, the isolation level defined by an esql SET TRANSACTION
ISOLATION LEVEL statement will be in effect at once, provided it is correctly
defined.

As per SQL standards, an isolation level can only be correctly defined before a
transaction begins. Thus, if a transaction is in progress, and the SET
TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL statement is executed, this would cause an error to
be raised.  Previously, ESQL would not detect this error. As of Release
10.2B01, ESQL will detect this error.

Note that the time immediately after a COMMIT or ROLLBACK is always before a
new transaction begins, and is a suitable place for SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION
LEVEL.


PSC00211889

As of OE 10.2B01, sql now returns an accurate message, saying
"ClassCastException occured in trigger execution". 


PSC00211179
=============================
SQL Explorer fails to connect to multiple databases
****************************************
Sqlexplorer (JDBC client) had an issue that would prevent it from dynamically
connecting to multiple databases by specifying configuration name in the url. 
Eg.
jdbc:datadirect:openedge://localhost:6790;databaseName=empty[-mdbq:Mlb Sales]

The part in the square brackets "[-mdbq:Mlb Sales]" caused sqlexplorer to
return NULL and fail connection . If the part in the url is not used, the
connection to the database would succeed

The issue was specific to sqlexplorer and limited to using the dynamic
connection feature in an MDBQ (multi database query) environment which uses
property files.

OEA Content Assist not refreshed to show database changes
****************************************
Content Assist on database fields, caches the database schema for quick display
of contents under content assist pop-up. The schema cache is never updated till
we restart the OpenEdge architect. 

In an event of Database schema change either via data dictionary or Db
navigator, say the user renames a field of a table in the database,  this
change won't be reflected until restart. Content assist pop-up will show the
old field name and 
when the renamed field is selected, error 138 is generated.

type is not decimal.


PSC00204202
=============================
Initial value code page conversion incorrect with UTF-8
****************************************
An initial value for a CHARACTER variable or temp-table field may be incorrect
under the following circumstances:
- the codepage of the r-code is different than the -cpinternal of the client
- one of the codepages is UTF-8, but the other is not
- the initial value contains non-ASCII characters
- there is no trim (:T) translation attribute on the value

Users might see this manifested as:
- An error message such as "Unable to update Field (142)"
- garbage characters in the character value
- the character value has been truncated

The workaround for this is not to use an initial value for CHARACTERs, but set
the initial value with an ASSIGN statement.
