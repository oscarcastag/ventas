     Progress DataDirect
     Example Readme File

Example is a simple application that uses ODBC and SQL.
It can be useful for:

* Executing any type of SQL statement
* Testing database connections
* Testing SQL statements
* Verifying your database environment

It can also be used to demonstrate ODBC function calls, including 
the following:

* SQLAllocConnect       * SQLError
* SQLAllocEnv           * SQLExecDirect
* SQLAllocStmt          * SQLFetch
* SQLBindCol            * SQLFreeConnect
* SQLColAttributes      * SQLFreeEnv
* SQLConnect            * SQLFreeStmt
* SQLDescribeCol        * SQLNumResultCols
* SQLDisconnect

To execute the application after setting up a data source, enter 
example on the command line on UNIX, or run example.exe on Windows.  
Follow the prompts to enter your data source name, user name, and 
password. If successful, a SQL> prompt appears and you can type in SQL 
statements such as Select * from <table_name>. If example is unable to 
connect, the appropriate error message appears.

Using a text editor, you can view the provided source code, example.c, 
to see specifically commented code.  You can customize example.c and 
build your own application.

Windows
-------
The example application can be built from the following files, located 
in the \SAMPLES\EXAMPLES directory of the DataDirect Connect Series for 
ODBC installation directory:

EXAMPLE.C         Example source
EXAMPLE.EXE       Example application
EXAMPLE.H         Example header
EXAMPLE.SLN       Example solution file
EXAMPLE.VCPROJ    Example project file
EXAMPLE.MAK       Example make file (instead of .SLN and .VCPROJ files 
                  on Itanium 64 only)


UNIX
----
Instructions for building example are contained inside the file 
example.mak, which can be read with a text editor. The application can 
be built from the following files, located in the /samples/example 
directory of the DataDirect Connect Series for ODBC installation 
directory:

example           Example application
example.c         Example source
example.h         Example header
example.mak       Example make file
