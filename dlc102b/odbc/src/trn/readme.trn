The file translat.c is an example of how to write a translation shared 
library.  It does not perform any actual translations on UNIX platforms.  
(The code is common-sourced across several platforms and uses the 
Microsoft AnsiToOem and OemToAnsi functions.  These functions are 
meaningless for UNIX and have been converted to straight string copy 
routines.)  

The provided makefile demonstrates the linker switches that must be used
to build the shared library translation module.
