Example is a simple application that uses ODBC and SQL.
It can be useful for:

* Executing any type of SQL statement
* Testing database connections
* Testing SQL statements
* Verifying your database environment

It can also be used to demonstrate ODBC function calls, including 
the following:

* SQLAllocConnect       * SQLError
* SQLAllocEnv           * SQLExecDirect
* SQLAllocStmt          * SQLFetch
* SQLBindCol            * SQLFreeConnect
* SQLColAttributes      * SQLFreeEnv
* SQLConnect            * SQLFreeStmt
* SQLDescribeCol        * SQLNumResultCols
* SQLDisconnect

To execute the application after setting up a data source, enter example on the
command line on UNIX, or run example.exe on Windows.  Follow the prompts 
to enter your data source name, user name, and password. If successful, 
a SQL> prompt appears and you can type in SQL statements such as 
Select * from <table_name>. If example is unable to connect, the appropriate 
error message appears.

Using a text editor, you can view the provided source code, example.c, 
to see specifically commented code.  You can customize example.c and build 
your own application, as follows:

Windows
-------
The example application is built from a Visual C++ version 6 workspace file.

1.  In Visual C++, go to the File menu and select Open Workspace.
2.  Browse until you locate the example.dsw file in the example subdirectory
    of the DataDirect Connect for ODBC installation directory.  Select 
    example.dsw.
3.  From the Build menu, select Build example.exe

The following files are provided:

EXAMPLE.C         Source file for example program
EXAMPLE.DSP       Project file for example program 
EXAMPLE.DSW       Workspace file for example program
EXAMPLE.H         Header file for example program
EXAMPLE.MAK       Make file for example program

UNIX
----
Instructions for building example are contained inside the file 
example.mak, which can be read with a text editor.

The following files are provided:

example           Example executable
example.c         Source file for example program
example.h         Header file for example program
example.mak       Make file for example program
