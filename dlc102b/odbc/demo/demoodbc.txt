Demoodbc is a simple demonstration application that uses ODBC.
It connects to the database of your choice using data sources
from your odbc.ini file, retrieves a table named EMP, and
displays the data from it. We provide SQL scripts to populate
the EMP table.  If you do not populate the EMP table before 
testing the connection, you will receive a message saying that
the specified object name (EMP) is invalid because it does not
exist in the database.  You should view this message as a
successful connection to the database.

You can also use demoodbc to persist the data from the EMP 
table to an XML data file. It names this XML data file EMP.xml 
and places it in the current directory.  Use the optional switch
-xml to persist the data.

NOTE: You cannot persist data to an XML data file using 
the dBASE, SQL Server Wire Protocol, or Text drivers.

Usage: 
demoodbc [-uid <username>] [-pwd <password>] [-xml] <datasource>

NOTE: If <datasource> contains spaces, you must enclose the value with
double quotes ("), for example, "Oracle WP".

Using a text editor, you can view the provided source code, demoodbc.c, 
to see specifically commented code.  You can customize demoodbc.c and 
build your own application by running the script Makefile.
