# This is a template for a unix-script which automatically upgrades
# an installed PROGRESS application.
# See the Toolkit manual for more details
#
# Step 1:  Unfreeze db-files, make new db-definitions and freeze files
#
#          Programs/files involved:
#
#          upgrade.p  : Progress start-up procedure.
#          loginupg.p : Special version of login.p to provide userid and 
#                       password for security-administrator.
#                       (Security-administrator must have read/write access to
#                        all files/fields in the database you want to access).
#          unfreeze.p : Progress procedure unfreezing db-files.
#          upgrade.df : ASCII-file with all db-changes (produced by
#                       dictionary option Dump Incremental Data Definitions
#          upgrade.inp: ASCII-file with the name of the  input .df-file
#          upgrade.log: ASCII-file with all output from the upgrade-run
#          freeze.p   : Progress procedure freezing db-files.
#
#      NOTE:  upgrade.p loginupg.p unfreeze.p freeze.p and compile.p
#             must be encrypted before running upgrade on a runtime-system.

echo Load new db-definitions
$PROEXE -rx $1 -1 -p upgrade.p
echo Loading completed


# Step 2:  Rebuild indexes (if you have dectivated)
#
#          Programs/files involved:
#
#          rebuild.inp: ASCII-file with input to idxbuild
#          rebuild.log: ASCII-file with all output from the rebuild-run

_proutil $1 -C idxbuild < rebuild.inp > rebuild.log

echo Index-rebuild completed



# Step 3:  Recompile Progress-procedures affected by the upgrade
#
#          Programs/files involved:
#
#          compile.p  : Progress-procedure with your compile-statements
#          compile.inp: ASCII-file with all procedures to be compiled
#          compile.log: ASCII-file with all output from the compile-run

echo Compile Progress-procedures

$PROEXE -rx  $1 -1 -p compile.p

echo Compilation completed
