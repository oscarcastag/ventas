# dumpdb
#
# sample script to dump a database
#
# Usage:	dumpdb
#
# WARNING: The program filedump.p which is created by mkdump is not quite
# suitable for this script.  That program is designed to be called from
# an interactive menu.  If you wish to run it directly from this script,
# you should insert the line:
#		output to /dev/tty.    (or some other file).
# at the beginning of filedump.p and then compile it to create filedump.r
#
# This script invokes progress with the -b option to make the job run
# non-interactively without a terminal, so that Ctrl-C will kill it instead
# of restarting the -p filedump program.
#
# Define the main application directory, APPLDIR. If
# APPLDIR has been defined in the user's .profile, that
# value is used here.  If not, the default value of
# /usr/acme is used.
APPLDIR=${APPLDIR-/usr/acme}

# Define the location of the PROGRESS software. If DLC
# has been defined in the user's .profile, that
# value is used here.  If not, the default value of
# /usr/dlc is used.
DLC=${DLC-/usr/dlc}; export DLC
PROEXE=${PROEXE-$DLC/bin/_progres}; export PROEXE

# Define the search path to be used to find procedures,
# using the directory named with the APPLDIR variable.
PROPATH=$APPLDIR; export PROPATH

# Display the version message.
cat $DLC/version

# Assign a database name.  If the user supplied a database
# name before starting this script, use that name.  If not
# use acmedb as the default database name.
DBNAME=${DBNAME-acmedb}

# Start PROGRESS in batch mode, and run dump procedure.
