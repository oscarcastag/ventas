=head1 NAME

InformixTechSupport - Technical Support tool for Informix Database Driver for Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<InformixTechSupport -V>

C<InformixTechSupport -v [ Perl | DBI | DBD::Informix | ESQL/C | Licence ]>

C<InformixTechSupport -l new#licence>

C<InformixTechSupport -b [ABCD] [test ...]>

C<InformixTechSupport -w>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The InformixTechSupport script is used for a variety of purposes
related to technical support of Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 1.00.PC1 (2000-03-03).

=head2 CHECKING SOFTWARE VERSIONS

Use C<InformixTechSupport -V> to discover the version number of each
of the components listed in the next section.

=head2 CHECKING VERSIONS OF SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

Use C<InformixTechSupport -v component> to discover the version number
of a component used by DBD::Informix.

The valid component names are:

=over 2

=item *

Perl

=item *

DBI

=item *

DBD::Informix

=item *

ESQL/C

=item *

Licence

=back

Other component names are silently ignored.
If you do not have a supported licence number, it will not be reported.

=head2 STORING A NEW LICENCE NUMBER

Use C<InformixTechSupport -l new#licence> to stamp your software with
the licence number you are given when you buy a support contract from
Informix Software Inc.
This number will then be reported when you make a bug report (see
below) or list all the versions (see above).

You must be able to write in the directory where the Informix.pm file
was installed to stamp the software, which will often require root
privileges.

=head2 CREATING A BUG REPORT

Use C<InformixTechSupport -b [class] [tests ...]> to create a basic
bug report.
The file Notes/bug.reports contains detailed information about the
classes of bug reports (which are A, B, C, and D).
If you have a class D bug, then you can list the specific test(s)
which are failing on the command line.

The output contains most of the information that will be needed to
debug your problem.
If your problem is not with the standard tests, then you should aim to
create a standalone reproduction of your problem and include that test
with your bug report.

=head2 CREATING A REPORT THAT IT WORKS

Use C<InformixTechSupport -w> to create a report that Informix Database Driver for Perl Version 1.00.PC1 (2000-03-03) works.
You may need to edit the output; you may certainly add comments in the
'Optional comments' section.
The output is written to standard output only.
It is never sent anywhere unless you actually choose to send it.

If you do send the report, please put "DBD::Informix - It Works" in
the subject line and send the report to C<dbd-informix@informix.com>.
