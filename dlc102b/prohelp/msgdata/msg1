49 "SYSTEM ERROR: Memory violation. (49)" "This Technical Support Knowledgebase entry describes what PROGRESS error 49 (Memory Violation) means and possible ways to correct it.

POSSIBLE CAUSE OF ERROR:
========================
This fatal error has a number of possible causes. Most commonly it appears in these instances:

1) Not enough memory or corrupted memory on the machine
2) Not enough configured swap space on the machine
3) Hardware failure
4) Corrupt compiled code (.r file)
5) Corrupt PROGRESS executable (i.e. _progres)
6) A PROGRESS executable compiled under an incompatible operating     system or operating system level
7) Corrupt data
8) Possible .bi file corruption
9) PROGRESS Bug

DOES ERROR INDICATE CORRUPTION:
===============================
Possibly                        

IF SO, WHAT TYPE:
=================
1. Data corruption, most notably a bad record.
2. Executable code corrupted in memory

CORRECTIVE MEASURES:
====================
To begin with, you need to determine when the error occurs and if it occurs consistently. Perhaps you've been running fine and now suddenly you start receiving the error. If so, think about what has changed since the error started occurring.

In general you can try:

Clearing memory on your machine by rebooting the system and see if the error 49 reappears.

Reducing the memory consuming startup parameters to save memory. To see what these parameters are set to, use the PROGRESS monitor (promon) or check the script (.bat on DOS,.com on VMS) or PROGRESS 
parameter file that you use to start the PROGRESS session.

Specific to the causes listed above you can try:

CAUSE#:
1 - Checking the amount of memory installed and the number of users on the system. A good rule of thumb for this relationship is 1MB for system and 1st user, then each additional MB will serve 2-3 users. An error 49 may also indicate that the stack has been corrupted because it is too small and is being overwritten.
Increasing -s may eliminate the error 49 in this case.

2 - Increasing swap space. This should be configured for an amount twice the installed RAM. You can run the system utility that shows swapping/paging information to see  what is happening (e.g.  S.A.R on UNIX or VMS monitor).

3 - Checking your hardware log to see if there are any other errors.

4 - Recompiling the compiled (.r) code that you are running. If this seems to cure the problem for a while, only to have it reappear, check the speed of the CPU versus the speed of the system
memory. It has been observed, on SCO OpenServer 5, with a dual CPU
running at 150MHz and 12nsec external cache RAM, the CPU is faster
than memory can handle.  Customer turned off external cache and error (49)s stopped.  Instructions with AMI motherboard state that if the CPU is moved from 66MHz to 100MHz, then change cache RAM from 15nsec to 12nsec.  Nothing about what to do for 150MHz CPU.

5 - Reinstalling PROGRESS.

6 - Verifying in the Technical Bulletin that you have at least
the first known operating system level that supports the PROGRESS
version you are running.

7 - Locating the bad record, deleting and recreating it. Or,
Dumping & Reloading that file. If you are not able to work with the
entire file at once, you may have to dump around the bad record(s) and load the data back in pieces.

8 - If you receive the system error (49) while in single user
mode, this could indicate .bi file corruption.  This could be caused by a hardware error.  Please check your system log files and run diagnostics if necessary.  To correct this problem, either go to backup or, if you have no backup available to you, you can force
access with the -F option and then dump/load to regain database
integrity.  Please note this latter option could result in the loss
of any data that was written to the .bi file but not yet written to
the .db file.

9 - If the error 49 is reproducible and none of the above measures fix it, it may be a Progress bug.  Narrow it down to code that is reproducible against the Progress demo or sports database and submit it to Progress Software Technical Support.

If you're on a UNIX machine, you may also be asked by a Progress
Technical Support Representative to dump the core file to an ASCII
file, using the system debugger and submit it to them for analysis.
