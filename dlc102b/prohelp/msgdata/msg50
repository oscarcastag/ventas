2468 "Unable to open the database file. (2468)" "If trying to connect to an AS400 database you receive errors like:

Unable to open the database file. (2468)
PRO9023 There is a client/server file mismatch for <file>.
PRO9024 There is a server schema/object mismatch for <file>.

It means that the schema holder doesn't match the server schema, or
the server schema doesn't match the object files on the AS/400.

If this is caused because you have modified the physical files using
AS/400 tools like DDS or IDDU, you need to run CHGPRODCT and create a
new schema holder (see KB 16671 for details).

This KBase applies when this error is caused because you have moved
your library from one machine to another and you are using Progress
version 8.1A or greater in the client. If you are using a previous
version of Progress in the client you will have to apply also the
approach described in KB 16671.

Progress version 8.1A provides a new parameter to use the CRC instead
of the timestamp for logical files. The CRC is an integer that has
been built by mathematically combining the logical file name, record
format ID, and each key's name, type, size, and position. Previous
versions of Progress used the time of file modification to know if 
the  file has been changed. This time changes when you restore your 
library from a tape, because the logical file is rebuilt.

The parameter is -Dsrv LFLVLCHK=CRC. Used when connecting the AS/400
database from the client, it will inform the DataServer to use the CRC rather than the timestamp.

Starting with 8.0C the CRC is calculated everytime a file definition
is processed, even when the new parameter -Dsrv LFLVLCHK=CRC is not
specified and timestamp is used.

So, if you move a library from one machine to another, the library
contains a server schema created with DataServer version 8.0C or
greater, and when trying to connect the client you receive error 2468, it is enough to specify -Dsrv LFLVLCHK=CRC in the AS/400 
connection parameters.
