1040 "SYSTEM ERROR: Not enough database buffers (-B). (1040)" "The following error:

   SYSTEM ERROR: Not enough database buffers (-B). (1040)

can occur when PROGRESS can not find an available buffer in the
database buffer pool in shared memory to store data into, even after trying several times.

If all buffers are filled and nothing can be evicted from the buffer pool because *every* buffer is locked, this message will occur and the database may shutdown.

This error should be rare and only occur where users are placing a
heavy workload on a database with a small -B.  A larger -B and running APW's should prevent this error from occurring. Currently the Workgroup Database Server do not have APW. See kbase 15340.

A -B of 500 to 1000 is considered a small size for the database
buffer pool.  If this error occurs, increase -B to at least 2000.

Running Asynchronous Page Writers (APW's) can help prevent this
error by ensuring that modified buffers are flushed to disk thus
making more buffers available.

Upon restarting the database after recieving this error (presumeably with a larger value for -B) crash recovery will occur and the database can be accessed normally again.  This error does *not* indicate any kind of database corruption.
