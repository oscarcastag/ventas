Progress Software Corporation uses the Open Source HTTPClient package to perform
its Java HTTP client operations.  Therefore, HTTPClient is redistributed via in
Progress Java libraries.   The HTTPClient package is made available through the
Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL), and may be obtained directly from the web site
www.innovation.ch/java/HTTPClient.  

To blend into Progress's software framework and provide some needed additional 
features, some changes were made to selected HTTPClient modules. Due to these
changes, Progress will comply with the HTTPClient's LGPL licence and make freely
available the modified HTTPClient source modules as well as all Progress written
source modules that are required to support those changes.

Included with this README file are two compressed files: 
    . The original HTTPClient version 0.3-3 distribution
    . The modified HTTPClient (SSLJ) files and Progress source files 

Two distributions are provided to support the major operating systems:
    UNIX:
        HTTPClient.tar.gz
        PscExtensions.jar
        
    Microsoft Windows:
        HTTPClient.zip
        PscExtensions.jar
    
Included in the PscExtensions.jar file are:

    #Modified HTTPClient sources and classes
    #Cookie.java parse method was modified to parse HttpOnly cookie attribute.
    # 
  
    HTTPClient/HttpConnection.java
    HTTPClient/Cookie.java
    AuthorizationModule.java
    HTTPResponse.java
        
    #Extensions of original HTTPClient sources
    #
    HTTPClient/NonStaticCookieModule.java
    
    #Progress source files to support HTTPClient source changes
    #
    com/progress/ubroker/util/ISSLParams.java
    com/progress/ubroker/util/ISSLSocketUtils.java

To rebuild the HTTPClient package with the Progress changes and extensions, 
you will have to obtain the RSAfollow these steps:

1)  Expand the compressed HTTPClient.??? file onto your system's disk drive.  
    The expansion operation will create the directory ./HTTPClient and populate 
    it with the HTTPClient source files

2)  Insure that the Java JDK version 3.0, or later, is in your PATH so that the
    jar and javac compiler is available
    
3)  While in the same directory, use the jar utility to expand the Java sources 
    files from the compressed PscExtensions.jar file.  You should now have two 
    sub-directories named:
    
        HTTPClient
        com
    
4)  Compile the Progress supplied files using the java compiler:

    javac com/progress/ubroker/util/*.java
    
4)  Make the following modifications the makefile from the HTTPClient 
    distribution:

    . append ";." for Microsoft Windows, or ":." for UNIXs, to the CLASSP and
      JDCLASSP macros in include the Progress class files into the compiler's
      CLASSPATH
      
    . Add this line to the classes macro to build the NonStaticCookieModule.java
      file:
      
        <TAB>NonStaticCookieModule.class
        
5)  Make any remaining adjustments to the Makefile as is required on your 
    OS platform
    
6)  Run the "make" utility from the HTTPClient directory
