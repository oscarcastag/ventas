3.1	Progress warrants that, for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of the initial shipment or availability for download from a Progress website of the Product whichever occurs first (the “Warranty Period”), (i) the Product will conform in all material respects to the Documentation for the Product found at the Progress Resource Center at  www.progress.com as of the delivery date of the Product (the “Documentation”) and (ii) the materials of the Product media are not defective and that the software is properly recorded on the media. As the sole and exclusive remedy for physically defective media (such as the diskettes, cartridges, CD-ROMs, DVDs or magnetic tapes), Progress will replace it free of charge if claimed during the Warranty Period.  As the sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of the Product to materially conform to the Documentation, Progress shall repair, replace, or correct the Product if such failure is reported during the Warranty Period or, if Progress, at its discretion, reasonably determines that such remedy is not economically or technically feasible, this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder will terminate and Progress or its supplier (as applicable) shall provide a full refund of the license fee paid with respect to the particular Product. The above warranties do not cover Updates, generic non-configured solution packs, any Product provided on an evaluation basis, or defects to the Product due to accident, abuse, service, alteration, modification or improper installation or configuration by Licensee, its personnel or any third party.  

3.2	Progress does not warrant that the functions of the Product will meet Licensee’s requirements or that operation of the Product will be uninterrupted or error free. Licensee assumes responsibility for selecting the Product to achieve its intended results and for the use and results obtained from the Product. 

3.3	THE LIMITED WARRANTY SPECIFIED IN SECTION 3.1 SETS FORTH ALL WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS PROVIDED TO LICENSEE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT AND SUCH LIMITED WARRANTY IS PROVIDED SOLELY BY PROGRESS AND NOT ITS LICENSORS. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY PROVIDED SOLELY BY PROGRESS TO LICENSEE PURSUANT TO SECTION 3.1, NEITHER PROGRESS NOR ITS LICENSORS, NOR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS, MAKE ANY OTHER EXPRESS WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS RELATING TO THE PRODUCT OR ANY SERVICES RELATED THERETO, AND FURTHER, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT AND ANY SERVICES RELATED THERETO. Further, the Product is not fault tolerant and is not designed, manufactured or intended for use in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance (including, without limitation, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility; direct life support machines; weapon systems; or control of aircraft, air traffic, aircraft navigation or aircraft communications), in which the failure of the Product could lead directly or indirectly to death, personal injury or severe physical or environmental damage. Without limiting the scope of the disclaimers set forth herein, Progress for itself and on behalf of its licensors and their respective suppliers, disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for any such high risk uses. 

4.  Indemnity

4.1	Progress will defend, indemnify and hold Licensee harmless against any and all costs and reasonable expenses finally awarded by a court or agreed to in settlement which directly result from any third party claim based on an allegation that a Product infringes either a valid (a) United States patent or (b) copyright of a country that is a party to the Agreement for Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (“TRIPS”) but only if Progress is notified promptly in writing of such claim and given sole control of the defense of any such claim and all negotiations for its settlement or compromise. Licensee agrees to reasonably cooperate with Progress in the defense, settlement or compromise of any such claim. In the event that a final injunction is obtained against Licensee’s use of the Product,  if Progress reasonably believes that Licensee’s use of the Products could be so enjoined, or if in Progress’s opinion the Product is likely to become the subject of a successful claim of such infringement, Progress shall, at its option and expense, (i) procure  for Licensee the right to continue using the Product as provided in this Agreement, (ii) modify or require replacement of the Product that Licensee is then currently using so that the Product becomes non-infringing (so long as the functionality of the Products is substantially similar) or, in the event neither of the previous two options are commercially reasonable for Progress, (iii) terminate this Agreement and the rights granted hereunder and refund to Licensee the amount paid to Progress for the Product less an amount for depreciation determined on a straight-line five year depreciation basis with a commencement date as of the respective shipment date of the applicable copies of the Product.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Progress shall have no liability for a claim to the extent based on (A) the use by Licensee of the Product more than thirty (30) days after Progress has notified Licensee of (i), (ii) or (iii), above or (B) the version of the Product used by Licensee is not the current release version of the Product.  

4.2	Notwithstanding the foregoing, Progress shall have no liability to Licensee under this Section 4 to the extent that any infringement or claim thereof is based upon (i) the combination, operation or use of a Product in combination with equipment or software not supplied by Progress hereunder where the Product would itself not be infringing, (ii) Licensee’s non-compliance with designs, specifi¬cations or instructions provided by Progress to Licensee, (iii) use of a Product in an application or environment for which it was not designed or not contemplated under this Agreement,  (iv) modifica¬tions of a Product by anyone other than Progress where the unmodified version of the Product would not be infringing, or (v) use by users or affiliated parties of Licensee not permitted by this Agreement. 

4.3	THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS STATE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF PROGRESS AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF LICENSEE WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY PROGRESS OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCT OR ITS USE.

4.4	If any affiliated  party of Licensee is specifically authorized in writing and as a term of this Agreement to use the Product pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof and Exhibit B, Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold Progress harmless for all acts and omissions of such affiliated party.  

5.	Confidentiality; Notices

5.1	Licensee acknowledges that the Products, including all source and/or object code and all parts and aspects thereof, and any modifications, enhancements, translations, localizations, or other derivative works thereof, in whatever form, whether or not marked as confidential, the Documentation and any other documentation or materials provided with or related to the Product (collectively, the “Confidential Information”), are the valuable proprietary and trade secret information of Progress and/or its licensors and suppliers.  Licensee shall (i) limit use and disclosure of the Confidential Information to its employees and its consultants who are authorized pursuant to this Agreement to use the Products and who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement or are otherwise bound to a confidentiality agreement containing substantially similar terms; (ii) not provide or disclose any of the Confidential Information to another party; and (iii) treat the Confidential Information with the same degree of care to avoid disclosure to any third party as is used with respect to Licensee’s information of like importance which is to be kept secret, but with no less than reasonable care.  The foregoing obligations shall be in addition to any obligations set forth in any separate confidentiality agreement between Progress and Licensee.   

5.2	Licensee agrees, under penalty of license termination but not exclusive of any other remedies, not to cause or permit the copying of the Product for any purpose other than expressly set forth herein.  Licensee may copy the Product only for archival and off-line backup purposes, but not for disaster recovery purposes unless Licensee has purchased the appropriate disaster recovery or replication license.  Licensee may copy the Documentation solely for the purpose of facilitating Licensee’s use of the Product in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Licensee agrees not to remove any product identification, copyright notices, or other notices or proprietary restrictions from the Product. 

5.3	Benchmark results for the Product may not be disclosed or published without the written consent of Progress. 

5.4	Licensee acknowledges that in the event of a breach or threat of breach of this Section 5, money damages will not be adequate.  Therefore, in addition to any other legal or equitable remedies, Progress shall be entitled to seek injunctive or similar equitable relief against such breach or threat of breach.

6.  Limitation of Liability
6.1	 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIABILITY OF PROGRESS, IF ANY, FOR DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY PRODUCT AND/OR SERVICES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE FOR SUCH PRODUCT AND/OR SERVICES.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL PROGRESS, ITS LICENSORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, OR ANY SERVICES, EVEN IF PROGRESS, ITS LICENSORS AND/OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. EACH EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION IS INTENDED TO BE A SEPARATE AND THEREFORE SEVERABLE EXCLUSION.

7.  Audit Rights

7.1	Progress may install, enable and utilize automated license tracking, management and/or enforcement solutions with the Products, which Licensee may not disrupt or alter.  Licensee shall maintain books and records in connection with this Agreement and the use of the Products.  Such books and records shall include at a minimum the number of licenses purchased and being used by Licensee.  At its expense and with reasonable written notice to Licensee, Progress or a third party appointed by Progress may audit the books, records, and if necessary, the systems on which the Product is installed for the sole purpose of ensuring compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  Progress shall have the right to conduct follow-up audits as necessary.  All audits shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's offices and shall not interfere unreasonably with Licensee's activities.  Progress shall treat all such records and books as confidential information. If any audit reveals that Licensee has underpaid license or maintenance fees, Licensee shall be invoiced for all such underpaid fees based on Progress list price in effect at the time the audit is completed.  If the underpaid fees are in excess of five percent (5%) of the fees previously paid by Licensee, then Licensee shall also pay Progress’s reasonable costs of conducting the audit and enforcement of this Agreement. 

8.   Termination

8.1	Progress may terminate this Agreement by written notice at any time if Licensee defaults in the performance of any provision of this Agreement and fails to cure such default to the satisfaction of Progress within thirty (30) days after such notice. This remedy shall not be exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which Progress may have under this Agreement or otherwise.

8.2	Any purported transfer or assignment of this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder by Licensee or other action by Licensee in contravention of Section 2.9 above or any purported transfer or assignment of this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder as a result of Licensee’s bankruptcy, insolvency, or liquidation or as a result of an assignment of Licensee’s assets for the benefit of creditors shall be void and this Agreement and the licenses granted hereunder shall thereupon automatically terminate without further notice or action by Progress.

8.3		Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement and/or any of the licenses granted hereunder, Licensee agrees to return promptly all copies of the Products and related Documentation to Progress or, if requested by Progress, destroy such Products and Documentation and certify in writing to such return or destruction.

To the extent there are any terms and conditions contained in Licensee’s purchase order or other documentation supplied by Licensee such terms and conditions shall be deemed to be stricken and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall govern.
