In order to run the Java RoundTripTest application, do the following:

1)  Copy RoundTrip.p to your AppServer working directory and compile
    it to .r code.

2)  Verify that your CLASSPATH environment variable contains $DLC\java\o4glrt.jar.

3)  Run RoundTripTest java program and specify your AppServer connection string as
    a parameter (i.e. AppServer://HostName:5162/asbroker1).

If the round trip test is successful you will get a message box displayed that
will contain the propath and working directory of your AppServer environment.
