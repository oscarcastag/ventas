Directory Contents
==================

Each subdirectory contains a promsgs file for the language that
it represents, a .df file for each codepage, and an empty database
that is marked with a codepage appropriate for the language.

Some directories have more than one .pf file, because a language is
used in more than one region. Although the language may be common to
these regions, other customs, such as date or number format or collation,
may be different and so other settings in the .pf file must be different.

Install will now create a startup.pf for you in the $DLC directory
with settings that you are prompted for. The .pf files in these directories
are just example settings.

convmap.dat Notes
=================
convmap.dat is now partitioned into several .dat files. convmap.dat
uses the new INCLUDE syntax to include the smaller files and still
build a comprehensive convmap.cp. The partioning makes the management
of the many tables easier and simpler.

convmap.dat and the other .dat files are now located in the
$DLC/prolang/convmap directory. The convmap.cp file remains in
$DLC.

The convmap directory also contains some new files, used for defining
word break rules. These files are named <codepage>bas.wbt. The "bas" is
for "basic", meaning the default behavior. There is one table for each
codepage family. The table can be used for the codepage that it is named for,
or for any codepage that it is convertible to.

The table $DLC/proword.def is the table provided with versions 7.x and 8.x of
PROGRESS and is provided for compatibility. We recommend installing the
new table that is appropriate for your database character set, and rebuilding
indexes, to get improvements in word indexing, but it is not required.

If you change any of the *.dat tables you can make a new convmap.cp with the
command:

proutil -C codepage-compiler $DLC/prolang/convmap/convmap.dat $DLC/convmap.cp

If you do not put the new convmap.cp in the $DLC directory, you can
instead point to this new file by using the -convmap startup parameter
or by setting the PROCONV environment variable. This is useful for testing
a modified convmap.cp, before installing on a deployed system.

If you want to list the codepages and collations available in the
current convmap.cp, you can use the procedure $DLC/prolang/list-cp.p.

If you want to list the supported codepage conversions available in
the current convmap.cp, you can use the procedure $DLC/prolang/listconv.p.

The tables provided below are output from these procedures.


Codepage Tables Available in the convmap.dat File
=================================================

                  Case Tables
----------------------------------
For every codepage, there is a table defining case rules
(upper and lower case letter mappings) named BASIC.
In addition, the following character sets provide case rules
for French as used in France. (In France, the uppercase of
version of a letter does not have an accent. In French Canada,
the uppercase letter will retain its accent.)

               Collation Tables
----------------------------------
Following, is a list of the collations provided for each
codepage.

The collations whose names begin "ICU-" are linguistic collations 
for Unicode data. The part of the name following "ICU-" is the 
standard locale name, except for ICU-UCA, which is the default 
Unicode Collation Algorithm.  ICU-ja__HQ distinguishes Hiragana 
from Katakana at the CASE-SENSITIVE strength when used as a database 
collation. All encodings of Unicode can use these collations.

               Conversion Tables
----------------------------------
Following is a list of every codepage conversion provided in convmap.cp.

Notes:
1) BIG-5 to CP950, KSC5601 to CP949, and KSC5601 to CP1361, are one-way
   conversions.
2) SHIFT-JIS to EUCJIS and EUCJIS to SHIFT-JIS cannot be used between 
   CPINTERNAL and CPSTREAM. These conversions are only for 
   client-server-database conversions. See the Internationalization Guide for
   more information.
