     Changes for Service Pack 2

* New Salesforce Driver provides access to Salesforce.com and Force.com 
  data sources. It supports the following features:

  - Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Data Encryption
  - Failover
  - DataDirect Bulk Load
  - Connection pooling
  - Report execution using stored procedures
  - Parameter arrays
  - Login timeout

  For more information about these features, refer to the 
  DATADIRECT CONNECT FOR ODBC SERIES USER'S GUIDE.


     Changes for Service Pack 1

DB2
---
* The DB2 Wire Protocol driver has been certified against the following 
  databases:
  - DB2 V10 for z/OS
  - DB2 V7R1 for iSeries

* For DB2 V7R1 for iSeries, the driver supports the following features:
  - XML data type. You use the XMLDescribeType (XDT) connection option 
    to specify whether the XML data type is mapped to the ODBC 
    SQL_WLONGVARCHAR or SQL_LONGVARBINARY type. Refer to the 
    description in the DATADIRECT CONNECT SERIES FOR ODBC USER'S GUIDE.

  - AES encryption during authentication. You use the 
    AuthenticationMethod (AM) connection option to specify the 
    authentication method. Refer to the description in the DATADIRECT 
    CONNECT SERIES FOR ODBC USER'S GUIDE.

   - ConcurrentAccessResolution (CAR) connection option. This option 
    determines the driver's behavior for read transactions when 
    committed rows are locked by a write transaction when the 
    application's isolation level is Read Committed or Repeatable 
    Read. DB2 V7R1 for iSeries does not currently support reading 
    currently committed data when operating on a table containing 
    LOBs. In this scenario, transactions always wait for a commit or 
    rollback operation if they encounter data that is being updated or 
    deleted. Refer to the description in the DATADIRECT CONNECT FOR 
    ODBC USER'S GUIDE.

* For DB2 V10 for z/OS, the driver supports the following features:
  - Data type support for:
    * Timestamp data type with variable precision. Timestamp values 
      with a fractional seconds precision > 9 are described as the ODBC 
      SQL_VARCHAR data type.

    * Timestamp with Time Zone data type. For more information, see the 
      description for the FetchTSWTZasTimestamp connection option in 
      this README file.

    * XML data type, including the ability to use XML data as input or 
      output parameters.

  - ConcurrentAccessResolution (CAR) connection option. This option 
    determines the driver's behavior for read transactions when 
    committed rows are locked by a write transaction when the 
    application's isolation level is Read Committed or Repeatable Read.
    DB2 V10 for z/OS does not currently support reading currently 
    committed data while performing UPDATE statements. In this 
    scenario, transactions always wait for a commit or rollback 
    operation if they encounter data that is being updated or deleted. 
    Refer to the description in the DATADIRECT CONNECT FOR ODBC USER'S 
    GUIDE.

  - New FetchTSWTZasTimestamp connection option. This option determines 
    whether the driver returns Timestamp with Time Zone columns as an 
    ODBC SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP or SQL_VARCHAR data type. If set to 1, the 
    driver maps Timestamp with Time Zone columns to the ODBC 
    SQL_TYPE_TIMESTAMP data type, which can result in time zone 
    information being truncated. If set to 0, they are mapped to 
    SQL_VARCHAR, allowing your application to retrieve the information 
    as a String. The default value is 0 (map to SQL_VARCHAR).

Greenplum

     Available ODBC Drivers

Database drivers are continually being added to each operating 
environment. For the latest information about the specific drivers 
available for your platform, refer to the Progress DataDirect database 
support matrix Web page at:

www.datadirect.com/products/odbc64/matrix/connect64odbc.htm


     Disk Space Requirements

The following available disk space requirements assume a full 
installation of all drivers and options.

DataDirect Connect for ODBC Drivers:

Windows x64      49 MB
Windows Itanium  55 MB

DataDirect Connect XE for ODBC Driver:

Windows x64      56 MB
Windows Itanium  31 MB


     Driver WorkAround Options

Progress DataDirect has included non-standard connection options 
(workarounds) for the drivers that enable you to take full advantage of 
packaged ODBC-enabled applications requiring non-standard or extended 
behavior.

Refer to the chapter "WorkAround Options" in the DATADIRECT CONNECT 
SERIES FOR ODBC REFERENCE for a description of these options.


     Notes, Known Problems, and Restrictions

The following are notes, known problems, or restrictions with 
Release 6.1.2 of the DataDirect Connect Series for ODBC drivers.

SQL Server Wire Protocol Driver
--------------------------------------
The SQL Server Wire Protocol driver requires an application to specify 
the size of timestamp parameters when they are bound. Setting the 
option WorkArounds2 to WorkArounds2=2 enables this behavior.

In addition, the driver does not allow an application to change the 
size of parameter bindings between execute calls. Setting the option 
WorkArounds to WorkArounds=536870912 enables this behavior.

Refer to the chapter "WorkAround Options" in the DATADIRECT CONNECT 
SERIES FOR ODBC REFERENCE for a description of these options.

Internet Explorer and Google Toolbar Users
------------------------------------------
Internet Explorer with the Google Toolbar installed sometimes displays 
the following error when the browser is closed: "An error has occurred 
in the script on this page." This is a known issue with the Google 
Toolbar and has been reported to Google. When closing the DataDirect 
Connect Series for ODBC help system, this error may display.

Upgrading from an Evaluation to a Licensed Installation
-------------------------------------------------------
If you have installed an evaluation copy of the drivers and want to 
upgrade to a licensed version, you must use the Modify option of the 
installation program. See the DATADIRECT CONNECT SERIES FOR ODBC 
INSTALLATION GUIDE for details about using the Modify option.

Installing and Removing Default Data Sources
--------------------------------------------
When you first install a driver, you are given the option to install a 
default data source for that driver. We recommend that you install 
default data sources when you first install the drivers. If you do not 
install the default data source at this time, you will be unable to 
install a default data source for this driver later even though this 
choice is available with the "Modify" window. To install a default data 
source for a driver after the initial installation, you must uninstall 
the driver and then reinstall it.

If you uninstall a 6.0 product after you have installed a 6.1 product, 
default data sources that were created by the installer and share the 
same name for both product versions will be removed from your machine.

For SSL Users
-------------
When trying to connect to a database using SSL encryption, you may 
receive an error message similar to: "PRNG not seeded". This is because 
certain versions of some operating systems do not generate truly random 
numbers necessary for encryption. For more information about this error 
and available patches, please refer to the Web site:

http://www.openssl.org/support/faq.html#USER1

SQLColAttribute(s)
------------------
The column attributes 1001 and 1002, which were assigned as DataDirect- 
specific attributes, were inadvertently used as system attributes by
the Microsoft 3.0 ODBC implementation. Applications using those 
attributes must now use 1901 and 1902, respectively.

SQL_C_NUMERIC
-------------
Because of inconsistencies in the ODBC specification, users attempting 
to use SQL_C_NUMERIC parameters must set the precision and scale values 
of the corresponding structure and the descriptor fields in the 
Application Parameter Descriptor.

For Informix Users
------------------
Restriction: Some Informix error messages may contain more than one 
error. All errors displayed may not be valid.

For Oracle 8 Server Users
-------------------------
The driver uses the XA protocol support in Oracle 8 to provide 
distributed transaction support. For recovery to work correctly, you 
must grant appropriate privileges on any server that will participate 
in a distributed transaction. You must grant the SELECT privilege on 
SYS.DBA_PENDING_TRANSACTIONS to all users that will use MTS. Refer to 
the Oracle 8 documentation for details on using Oracle XA.

For Microsoft SQL Server Users
------------------------------
If you have problems with the catalog functions returning incorrect 
data, you may need to upgrade your catalog stored procedures. Make 
sure that you have installed the latest version of the stored  
procedures, which are available from your database vendor. Refer to 
your Microsoft SQL Server documentation for more information.

The SQL Server Wire Protocol drivers return stored procedure names with 
the version number appended to them. For example, a procedure defined 
as "proc1" will be returned as "proc1;1".

The SQL Server Legacy Wire Protocol driver does not support multiple 
active statements on a single connection by default. See the Microsoft 
document for information about how to enable multiple active statements 
on a single connection using server-side cursors:

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q140896/

When using the SQLDescribeParam method, the SQL Server Legacy Wire 
Protocol driver describes parameters that map to the Microsoft SQL 
Server 2008 date, time, datetime2, and datetimeoffset data types as 
SQL_WVARCHAR.

The options listed in the "WorkAround Options" chapter of the 
DATADIRECT CONNECT SERIES FOR ODBC REFERENCE cannot be used with the 
SQL Server Legacy Wire Protocol driver.

For Sybase Users
----------------
You may experience a problem using catalog stored procedures when 
running the Sybase Wire Protocol driver with Sybase Adaptive Server 
11.5. Contact Sybase and ask for the latest version of their catalog 
stored procedures.

On the Logon dialog box, there is a Database drop-down list that 
displays the database names specified on the Connection tab of the ODBC 
Sybase Wire Protocol Driver Setup dialog box. This functionality is 
available in all cases except when connecting through the Test Connect 
button on the Setup dialog box. When connecting through the Test 
Connect button, only the default database specified on the General tab 
of the Setup dialog box is available.

For 64-Bit Oracle Client Interface (OCI) Users
----------------------------------------------
During tests of the DataDirect Connect64 for ODBC Oracle driver, the 
OCI in some cases returned incorrect data for several columns in a 
particular row, while in other cases, it returned the row correctly. 
Progress DataDirect has determined that the OCI default of pre-fetching 
a row is the source of the problem.

Consequences of the problem can be as severe as a core dump. Disabling 
pre-fetching is the recommended workaround. A connection string 
attribute is available that does not appear in the driver configuration 
dialog boxes or the documentation: EnablePreFetch (EPF). The default 
for this attribute is 1 (enable pre-fetching). Setting this option to 0 
in a connection string or a data source 
(HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ODBC\.odbc.ini in the Windows Registry) 
causes the driver to disable pre-fetching in the OCI.

If you have issues using DTC with the Oracle driver, use the Oracle 
Wire Protocol driver as an alternative.
