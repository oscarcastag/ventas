it free of charge if claimed during the Warranty Period.  As the sole and 
exclusive remedy for any failure of the Product to materially conform to the

the license fee paid with respect to the particular Product. The above 
warranties do not cover Updates, generic non-configured solution packs, any

FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, PROGRESS, ITS LICENSORS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE 
SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, 
RELATING TO THE PRODUCT, OR ANY SERVICES OR UPDATES PROVIDED UNDER THIS 
AGREEMENT.  ANY UPDATES OR SERVICES DELIVERED HEREUNDER ARE DELIVERED "AS 
IS" WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR 
OTHERWISE. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ALL OTHER 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY 
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE 
AND NON-INFRINGEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE PRODUCT, OR ANY SERVICES AND 
UPDATES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED. Further, the Product is

injury or severe physical or environmental damage. Without limiting the scope 
of the disclaimers set forth herein, Progress for itself and on behalf of its 
licensors and their respective suppliers, disclaims any express or implied 
warranty of fitness for any such high risk uses. 

4.  Indemnity

4.1  Progress will defend, indemnify and hold Licensee harmless against any 
and all costs and reasonable expenses finally awarded by a court or agreed to 
in settlement which directly result from any third party claim based on an 
allegation that a Product infringes either a valid (a) United States patent 
or (b) copyright of a country that is a party to the Agreement for Trade 
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ("TRIPS") but only if 
Progress is notified promptly in writing of such claim and given sole control 
of the defense of any such claim and all negotiations for its settlement or 
compromise. Licensee agrees to reasonably cooperate with Progress in the 
defense, settlement or compromise of any such claim. In the event that a final 
injunction is obtained against Licensee's use of the Product,  if Progress 
reasonably believes that Licensee's use of the Products could be so enjoined, 
or if in Progress's opinion the Product is likely to become the subject of a 
successful claim of such infringement, Progress shall, at its option and 
expense, (i) procure  for Licensee the right to continue using the Product 
as provided in this Agreement, (ii) modify or require replacement of the 
Product that Licensee is then currently using so that the Product becomes 
non-infringing (so long as the functionality of the Products is substantially 
similar) or, in the event neither of the previous two options are commercially 
reasonable for Progress, (iii) terminate this Agreement and the rights granted 
hereunder and refund to Licensee the amount paid to Progress for the Product 
less an amount for depreciation determined on a straight-line five-year 
depreciation basis with a commencement date as of the respective shipment 
date of the applicable copies of the Product.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Progress shall have no liability for a claim to the extent based on (A) the 
use by Licensee of the Product more than thirty (30) days after Progress has 
notified Licensee of (i), (ii) or (iii), above or (B) the version of the 
Product used by Licensee is not the current release version of the Product.  

4.2  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Progress shall have no liability to 
Licensee under this Section 4 to the extent that any infringement or claim 
thereof is based upon (i) the combination, operation or use of a Product in 
combination with equipment or software not supplied by Progress hereunder 
where the Product would itself not be infringing, (ii) Licensee's 
non-compliance with designs, specifications or instructions provided by 
Progress to Licensee, (iii) use of a Product in an application or environment 
for which it was not designed or not contemplated under this Agreement,  
(iv) modifications of a Product by anyone other than Progress where the 
unmodified version of the Product would not be infringing, or (v) use by 
users or affiliated parties of Licensee not permitted by this Agreement. 

4.3  THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS STATE THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF 
PROGRESS AND THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF LICENSEE WITH RESPECT TO ANY 
INFRINGEMENT OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT BY PROGRESS OF ANY INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN RESPECT OF THE PRODUCT OR ITS USE.

4.4  If any affiliated  party of Licensee is specifically authorized in writing 
and as a term of this Agreement to use the Product pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof 
and Exhibit A, Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold Progress harmless for 
all acts and omissions of such affiliated party.  

5.  Confidentiality; Notices

5.1  Licensee acknowledges that the Products, including all source and/or object 
code and all parts and aspects thereof, and any Updates, modifications, 
translations, localizations, or other derivative works thereof, in whatever 
form, whether or not marked as confidential, the Documentation and any other 
documentation or materials provided with or related to the Product 
(collectively, the "Confidential Information"), are the valuable proprietary 
and trade secret information of Progress and/or its licensors and suppliers.  
Licensee shall (i) limit use and disclosure of the Confidential Information to 
its employees and its consultants who are authorized pursuant to this Agreement 
to use the Products and who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement or 
are otherwise bound to a confidentiality agreement containing substantially 
similar terms; (ii) not provide or disclose any of the Confidential Information 
to another party; and (iii) treat the Confidential Information with the same 
degree of care to avoid disclosure to any third party as is used with respect 
to Licensee's information of like importance which is to be kept secret, but 
with no less than reasonable care.  The foregoing obligations shall be in 
addition to any obligations set forth in any separate confidentiality agreement 
between Progress and Licensee.   

5.2  Licensee agrees, under penalty of license termination but not exclusive of 
any other remedies, not to cause or permit the copying of the Product for any 
purpose other than expressly set forth herein.  Licensee may copy the Product 
only for archival and off-line backup purposes, but not for disaster recovery 
purposes unless Licensee has purchased the appropriate disaster recovery or 
replication license.  Licensee may copy the Documentation solely for the 
purpose of facilitating Licensee's use of the Product in accordance with, and 
subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Licensee agrees not 
to remove any product identification, copyright notices, or other notices or 
proprietary restrictions from the Product. 

5.3  Benchmark results for the Product may not be disclosed or published 
without the written consent of Progress. 

5.4  Licensee acknowledges that in the event of a breach or threat of breach of 
this Section 5, money damages will not be adequate.  Therefore, in addition to 
any other legal or equitable remedies, Progress shall be entitled to seek 
injunctive or similar equitable relief against such breach or threat of breach.

5.5  All notices and requests in connection with this Agreement to be sent to 
Progress shall be given in writing and shall be sent by hand delivery, 
overnight courier or certified mail with proof of delivery to the following 
address:  14 Oak Park Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, Attention: General Counsel.  
All notices and requests in connection with this Agreement to be sent to 
Licensee shall be given in writing and shall be sent by hand delivery, 
overnight courier or certified mail with proof of delivery to the address 
first set forth in the Order.  Either party may change its address for receipt 
of notices upon written notice to the other party, and notices shall be deemed 
given on the day of receipt or the date evidenced on the proof of delivery, 
whichever is earlier.

6.  Limitation of Liability.

6.1  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIABILITY OF 
PROGRESS, IF ANY, FOR DAMAGES RELATING TO ANY PRODUCT, UPDATE AND/OR 
SERVICES SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAID BY LICENSEE FOR SUCH 
PRODUCT, UPDATE AND/OR SERVICES. PROGRESS'S LICENSORS AND THEIR SUPPLIERS 
SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY TO LICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES SUFFERED BY LICENSEE OR 
ANY THIRD PARTY AS A RESULT OF USING THE PRODUCT, ANY UPDATE, OR ANY PORTION 
THEREOF, OR AS A RESULT OF ANY SERVICES RELATING THERETO. NOTWITHSTANDING 
THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL PROGRESS, ITS LICENSORS, OR ANY OF THEIR 
RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR 
INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
CHARACTER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR 
LOSSES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING 
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PRODUCT, ANY UPDATE, OR ANY PORTION 
THEREOF, OR ANY SERVICES, EVEN IF PROGRESS, ITS LICENSORS AND/OR ANY OF THEIR 
RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
EACH EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION IS INTENDED TO BE A SEPARATE AND THEREFORE 
SEVERABLE EXCLUSION.

7.  Audit Rights.  Progress may install, enable and utilize automated license 
tracking, management and/or enforcement solutions with the Products, which 
Licensee may not disrupt or alter.  Licensee shall maintain books and records 
in connection with this Agreement and the use of the Products and any Updates 
and/or services provided hereunder.  Such books and records shall include at a 
minimum the number of licenses purchased and being used by Licensee.  At its 
expense and with reasonable written notice to Licensee, Progress or a third 
party appointed by Progress may audit the books, records, and if necessary, 
the systems on which the Product or any Update is installed for the sole 
purpose of ensuring compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  Progress 
shall have the right to conduct follow-up audits as necessary.  All audits 
shall be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's offices and 
shall not interfere unreasonably with Licensee's activities.  Progress shall 
treat all such records and books as confidential information. If any audit 
reveals that Licensee has underpaid license or maintenance and support fees, 
Licensee shall be invoiced for all such underpaid fees based on Progress list 
price in effect at the time the audit is completed.  If the underpaid fees are 
in excess of five percent (5%) of the fees previously paid by Licensee, then 
Licensee shall also pay Progress's reasonable costs of conducting the audit 
and enforcement of this Agreement. 

8.  Termination.

8.1  Progress may terminate this Agreement by written notice at any time if 
Licensee defaults in the performance of any provision of this Agreement and 
fails to cure such default to the satisfaction of Progress within thirty (30) 
days after such notice. This remedy shall not be exclusive and shall be in 
addition to any other remedies which Progress may have under this Agreement 
or otherwise.

8.2  Any purported transfer or assignment of this Agreement or the licenses 
granted hereunder by Licensee or other action by Licensee in contravention of 
Section 2.10 above or any purported transfer or assignment of this Agreement

executed by both Progress and Licensee.

and which can be accessed by other computers.  The term "Server" 
includes, but is not limited to, web servers, batch servers and 
application servers.

Connection Basis License (for DataDirect Connect for ODBC only):  
If the Product is licensed on a Connection basis, then a license fee 
must be paid for both the maximum number of simultaneous Connections 
utilized by the Server and the maximum number of processors ("CPUs") 
utilized by the Server whether or not such access is simultaneous or 
consecutive. For the purposes of this provision only a "Connection" 
shall be defined as the driver state after a successful call to 
SQLConnect, SQLDriverConnect, or SQLBrowseConnect and before 
termination of this state, normally through a successful call to 
SQLDisconnect.  Servers utilizing dual core processing (or multiple 
core processing) or other multi-processor technology shall have 
each core processor count as one (1) CPU. The Product may only be 
used by Server-based applications running on that Server accessed 
by other computers and may not be installed via file sharing on a 
local area network file system.  

Connection Basis (for DataDirect Connect for JDBC only):  
If the Product is licensed on a Connection basis, then a license 
fee must be paid for both the maximum number of simultaneous

other multi-processor technology shall have each core processor count 
as one (1) CPU. The Product may only be used by Server-based 
applications running on that Server accessed by other computers and 
may not be installed via file sharing on a local area network file 
system. 

Core Licenses:  A Product licensed on a "Core" basis grants Licensee 
the right to run the Product on a single Core on a single server.  
The total number of Cores on the machine may not exceed the total 
number licensed to Licensee. Additional Core License(s) are required 
for each Core of the server on which the Product runs, including, 
without limitation, servers configured for disaster recovery, load 
balancing, clustering, development, testing and reporting.  

For purposes of the "Core" license model:

 "Core" means a core of a CPU as allocated by Licensee made up of 
an independent processor combined onto a single integrated circuit 
or silicon chip, in both virtualized and/or non-virtualized 
environment, and regardless of whether used in a production or 
non-production (e.g. test, development) environment.

 "CPU" means a computer processing unit, also known as a processor 
or microprocessor. It can contain multiple cores in both virtualized 
and/or non-virtualized environment.

CPU:  A CPU License grants Licensee the right to run the Product, or 
an application which can access the Product, on a single core 
processing unit ("CPU") on a single server and on a single Platform. 
Each processor core of a multiple core processor in a server shall 
count as one (1) CPU.  Additional CPU License(s) are required for each 
CPU that runs the Product, including, without limitation, servers 
configured for disaster recovery, load balancing, clustering, 
development, testing and reporting. A CPU License may not be 
transferred from one CPU or one Platform to another. 

Developer:   A Developer License limits Licensee's access and use of 
the Product to internal application development and support purposes 
only.  If the license is for components of the Product only, then 
such right is limited to such components.   Licensee shall be 
further subject to the license terms of the appropriate license 
model for the Product set forth in this Exhibit A.  A Developer 
License may not be transferred. 

Disaster Recovery:  A Disaster Recovery License shall only be used 
by Licensee for the sole purpose of application recovery in the 
event a system fails or crashes or the Product or database files 
become corrupt.  Licensee shall be further subject to the license 
terms of the appropriate license model for the Product set forth 
in this Exhibit A. A Disaster Recovery License may be transferred 
from one server or CPU to another with prior notice to Progress so 
long as such change is permitted by the underlying license model.  
No Disaster Recovery license is required for a switch from a 
primary server to secondary server so long as the primary server 
is permanently disabled.  However a Disaster Recovery license is 
required for any other temporary reassignment between the primary 
server and any other server.  The foregoing transfer right shall 
not affect the assignment prohibition set forth in Section 2.10 
of this Agreement.

Evaluation:  If a Product is licensed on an evaluation basis, 
the Product may be used by Licensee solely for evaluation and 
testing purposes and not for deployment or production purposes 
for a period of fifteen (15) days from download or receipt 
(as the case may be) unless a different term is listed in an Order.  
THE WARRANTIES SET FORTH IN SECTION 3 OF THE AGREEMENT DO NOT APPLY.  
PROGRESS MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO A PRODUCT LICENSED ON 
AN EVALUATION BASIS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR ARISING BY CUSTOM OR 
TRADE USAGE, AND SPECIFICALLY MAKES NO WARRANTY OF INFRINGEMENT, 
MERCHANTABILITY OR OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Licensee 
shall be further subject to the license terms of the appropriate 
license model for the Product set forth in this Exhibit A.  

z/OS Operating System Image Basis:  If the Product is licensed to 
Licensee on an z/OS Operating System Image basis, then a license 
fee must be paid for the number of z/OS Operating System Images 
where the Product is installed.  Licensee shall identify the number 
of z/OS Operating System Images where the Product is installed and 
provide the information to Progress.

Testing and Staging License:  A Testing and Staging License grants 
Licensee the right to use the Product for internal quality assurance 
testing purposes only and Licensee may not deploy the Product in a 
production environment.  Licensee shall be further subject to the 
license terms of the appropriate license model for the Product set 
forth in this Exhibit A.  A Testing and Staging License may not be 
transferred.

Workstation Basis:  If the Product is licensed on a Workstation basis, 
each Workstation using or accessing the Product must be licensed.  
A license must be purchased for each Workstation using or accessing 
the Product.  A "Workstation" shall be defined as a computer that is 
operated, either attended or via remote access, by one person at a 
time, and cannot be used by more than one person, directly or 
indirectly, simultaneously.  In no event shall the number of 
workstations utilizing or accessing the Product exceed the number of 
Workstations identified in the Order Letter.

THIRD PARTY TERMS AND RESTRICTIONS:

The Product may contain or be accompanied by certain third-party 
components which are subject to additional restrictions.  These 
components, if any, are identified in, and subject to, special 
license terms and conditions set forth in either the "[readme].txt" 
file or the [notices.txt] file accompanying the Product ("Special 
Notices"). The Special Notices include important licensing and warranty 
information and disclaimers.  In the event of conflict between the 
Special Notices and the other portions of this Agreement, the Special
