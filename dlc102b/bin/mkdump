# DLCTK Usage mkdump <dbname>
# It creates filedump.p, filedump.r fileload.p, and fileload.r in the
# current working directory
#
# Note: _procomp is executed with the -b option because this is
# essentially a non-interactive job.  The -p startup program mkdmpld.p
# must therefore begin with an OUTPUT TO statement, in case any output
# is generated.
